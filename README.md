# Example standalone Angular client application hosted by a Node.js server

## Prerequisites
install `Node.js`, `npm` and `git`.

## Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ntnu-tdat2004/angular-standalone-client
cd angular-standalone-client
```

## Install dependencies
* Install global npm packages:
  ```sh
  npm install -g nodemon webpack
  ```
  If you receive an error, try add `sudo` before the above command.

* Install JavaScript dependencies (settings file: package.json):
  ```sh
  cd client
  npm install
  cd ../server
  npm install
  cd ..
  ```

## Build and run
*  Open a second terminal in the same directory

* Build the client sources to `dist/bundle.js` to reduce the download size and enable the newest JS standard:
  ```sh
  # In terminal 1
  cd client
  webpack --watch
  ```
  `dist/bundle.js` is automatically updated when the client source files are altered.

* Run node server with newest JS standard (harmony) enabled:
  ```sh
  # In terminal 2
  cd server
  nodemon --harmony server.js
  ```
  `nodemon` ensures that the server restarts when the source files have been changed.

* Open http://localhost:3000
